"The era of Saas is dead!"  The proclamations from the press a few months ago were loud and hard to ignore.  But does that mean you have to reconsider every single software decision you make?  Certainly, the decision-making process has changed, but I don't think AI will make the SaaS industry obsolete overnight.

In this article, I will take a new look at my decision-making process for whether to build that piece of software or buy it.

## Is it core to your business?

This question is the most basic one, and it's a clear signal to buy, not build.  Some software is core to your business.  You cannot function as a business without it.  Your CRM likely falls into this group, as does your accounting software, tied to invoicing or paying your staff.

We also have plenty of software which is not core to the business.  Most AI tools fall into this camp.  My software development environment falls into this bucket as well, even though software development is what I do. (For reference, I do consider my CI/CD system and software repositories as core to my business.)  There is no "system of record" in my software development studio.  My business does not stop if I can't develop software immediately.  If VSCode and my compiler stopped working today, I could be up and running on a different editor tomorrow.

If the software function is not core to your business, buy it.  Don't build it.

## Does it have specific compliance and governance requirements?

After the previous example, you might consider building a new accounting system because the old one doesn't quite work the way you want it to.  The folks who run accounting applications have a myriad of compliance and governance requirements that require specific knowledge - that you likely don't have.  They know how long you have to keep records for, what the reporting requirements for taxes are, and a myriad of other compliance items that you would have to hire expertise for.

Compliance and governance are also moving targets.  Every time the compliance and governance ecosystem changes, so does your software.  Are you ready for matching that movement?

You are hiring expertise. It just comes as a software package.  Buy it.

## What is the cadence of external change?

I've already mentioned the moving compliance and governance target.  Two other targets are important.  First, the security risk.  Security is a board-level concern.  Security is also an ever-changing landscape and something that is "secure" when you put it in the field may not remain so within hours, thanks in large part to AI automation.  Even if you think you can keep ahead of the security concerns, your software does not live on an island.  It will have to interface with multiple systems that are outside your control - from databases, to social media APIs, to banking rails.  Maintenance is ongoing.

Are you prepared to fund ongoing maintenance that adds no value to the software?  If not, buy it.

## What is the total lifecycle cost at scale?

AI makes "day 1" (the initial code output) cheap, but "day 2" (ongoing support and maintenance) covers observability, dependency updates, security patching, and bug triage.  That scales with code volume.  You not only have to write the software, but run it too.  

Those engineers that you have to assign to this task of maintaining an internal tool are then not shipping software elsewhere.  What strategic initiative are you deprioritizing to maintain the tool long-term?

Are you willing and ready to fund ongoing support?  If not, buy it.

## Do you need roadmap control, data sovereignty, or portability?

All the questions so far have been indicators to buy, but not necessarily indicators to build.  Buying SaaS puts your operational timeline at the mercy of a third-party.  If the vendor doesn't think your roadmap addition is worth it for 18 months, or they sunset a key feature you rely on, how disruptive will that be to your operations?  Similarly, if the vendor decides to withdraw from a region you operate in, what will you do?

Once you've worked through all the other questions, and it's still a toss-up, determine how much you need roadmap control.  If the answer is "a lot", then perhaps it's time to consider building it.

## Final thoughts

When it comes to a build vs. buy decision, it's never about the initial investment.  It's about the long-term viability of the software.  SaaS vendors have been working at their specific niche for a long time.  They know all the edge cases and can operate at scale.  AI has changed the equation when it comes to the initial investment, but has done nothing for the long-term viability and judgement it takes to operate in a complex arena.

Consider the following items:

1. **Strategy**: Does this software create direct competitive differentiation?
2. **Operations**: Are there non-negotiable data residency, privacy, or audit constraints?
3. **Capability**: Do you have dedicated engineering to own maintenance, patches, and updates indefinitely?
4. **Domain**: Does the problem space involve highly volatile rules, localized tax, or complex edge cases?
5. **Economics**: Is the long-term TCO of internal maintenance lower than subscription costs?

You will notice that these five questions are the same as before AI.  The decision tree is the same as before.  You may discount the economics of internal maintenance, but it's still a cost, and the other four questions can't be affected by AI.

Is SaaS dead?  I believe that AI will depress SaaS growth in the short term, but once companies determine that the same questions arise, they will continue operating just like before.

This also provides a roadmap for what makes good SaaS.  Again, the emphasis is not on the initial code.  Do you provide value across operations, capability, and expert domain knowledge?  Can you do this cheaper than the customer can?  You likely have a great idea for a SaaS.
